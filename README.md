Currently I operate as Senior DevOps Engineer for Kordia Ltd as of November 2021.  The prior 5 years I was an IT Manager that included systems engineering, turnkey on-premise infrastructure builds, large-scale render farms, and client solutions with some DevOps for a video photogrammetry company. That startup had some 90+ folks employed. This required on-premise IT infrastructure design and deployment in multiple countries both for us and our clients. Here, I learned Ansible as a tool to commission bare metal render farms and maintain systems in Wellington, Seoul, and Tokyo. That job was great and very fast paced. The best part was learning new tech and occasionally fielding some left field challenges. This was my first startup and I’d likely do another if the tech was interesting to me.

Before that has been a 50/50 split of technical and creative experiences. I’ve a past background in on-set production and post VFX / Compositing which included on-set and post audio for small movies, music, and commercials in Nashville and New York City. Today, I'm currently studying CyberSecurity and https://www.kite.nz in my spare time.
